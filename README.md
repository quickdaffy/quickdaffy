# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm quickdaffy, or just quick. I've been programming since I was 9, and have never stopped loving it.
I started with Ruby, then HTML/CSS, and now Java, C++, and C# (but mostly java).
I also make tutorials on YouTube on how to create a PVP client, check them out! www.youtube.com/quickdaffy

I have multiple projects going on at the moment, the biggest one being Monsoon, a Player Assistance Mod for Minecraft. Check it out at http://monsoon.wtf
