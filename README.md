# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm quickdaffy, or just quick. I've been programming since I was 9, and have never stopped loving it.
I started with Ruby, then HTML/CSS, and now Java, C++, and C# (but mostly java).

I mostly make PVP Clients for Minecraft, such as Solar (https://discord.gg/Aux6kUMvfT).

If you ever need help with Minecraft Programming, please feel free to DM me on discord! Make sure your question is reasonable, I won't help you skid.
